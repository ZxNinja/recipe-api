<h1>Plate Plan User Data Deletion Policy</h1>

<p>This policy details the process for users to request the deletion of their personal data collected by the Plate Plan mobile application, primarily through **Facebook Login**.</p>

<h2>Your Right to Deletion</h2>
<p>As outlined in our main Privacy Policy, you have the right to request the deletion of all personal data we have collected about you. This typically includes your **Name**, **Email Address**, **Contact/Phone Number**, and **Facebook User ID**.</p>

<p>Once your data is deleted, your access to the Plate Plan service will be permanently revoked, and you will need to create a new account to use the service again.</p>

<h2>Methods for Data Deletion</h2>
<p>You have two simple ways to initiate the data deletion process:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Via Facebook Settings (Recommended):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the **"Apps and Websites"** section within your Facebook Settings.</li>
            <li>Find and select the **"Plate Plan"** application.</li>
            <li>Click the **"Remove"** button to revoke Plate Plan's access to your data.</li>
            <li><strong>What Happens Next:</strong> When you remove the app from your Facebook settings, Meta sends us an automated notification. Upon receiving this notification, we will delete all associated data from our servers within **30 days**.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Via Direct Email Request:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Send an email to our dedicated support address: **<a href="mailto:plateplan@gmail.com">plateplan@gmail.com</a>**</li>
            <li>The email subject line **must** be: **"Data Deletion Request"**</li>
            <li>In the body of the email, please include your **registered Email Address** and/or your **Facebook User ID** so we can locate your account.</li>
            <li><strong>What Happens Next:</strong> We will process the deletion of your account and associated personal data within **30 days** of confirming your request.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Retention after Deletion Request</h2>
<p>Once the deletion request is confirmed through either method:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All personal data collected via Facebook Login will be **permanently deleted** from our live production systems.</li>
    <li>We may retain anonymized, aggregated data that cannot be linked back to you for internal analytics and service improvement.</li>
    <li>A small amount of data may be retained in secure backup systems for a limited period (e.g., 90 days) but is subject to deletion upon the next scheduled backup cleanup and is not accessible by our live systems.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Important Note:</strong> The deletion process only covers the data Plate Plan has collected. If you wish to delete your entire Facebook account, you must do so directly through Facebook's settings.
